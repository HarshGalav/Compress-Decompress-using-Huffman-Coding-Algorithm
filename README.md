# Compress-Decompress-using-Huffman-Coding-Algorithm

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project enables compression and decompression of text files using Huffman Coding. It builds a Huffman tree, generates binary codes for characters, and compresses data efficiently. A frequency file is also generated to enable accurate decompression.
